# Coding Game

https://www.codingame.com/

I haven't been using CodingGame for the last years and there were several changes in the platform that I was not aware. For example, I lost all my Python 2 solutions, since they no longer support the language (only Python 3). 

# Disclaimer: 

Keep in mind that most of my solutions in this repository were implemented in `Java` in 2015-2016.

At the time, the solution codes were implemented without much concern to maintainability and clean code principles. The objective was only to provide a solution capable to pass all problem test cases. Also, some solutions were implemented under a competitive pressure.
