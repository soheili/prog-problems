Q7. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-7/problem


Step 1.

Rewrite Y on X: y = -8 - 3/4x  (b_x = -3/4)
Rewrite X on Y: x = -7 - 3/4y (b_y = -3/4)

Step2. Pearson correlation
p = -3/4 * (std_x / std_y)
p = -3/4 * (std_y / std_y)

p * p = -3/4 * (std_x / std_y) * -3/4 * (std_y / std_y)
p * p = -3/4 * -3/4
p = -3/4 or 3/4

Step 3. Positive or negative

The slope is negative of both correlations, so the answer is -3/4
